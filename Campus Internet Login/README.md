<h1>Campus Internet Login</h1>
<h2>Description: <h2>
<h4>This script is designed for SMVDU students to automate their internet login process. We are logged out automatically if our internet connection is idle for a certain period of time, and this happens quite a lot with us. This Script is currently designed for linux users only, but soon (in a day or two) it will be available for windows as well as mac users. There may be any problem with someone using it, please tell me on facebook, so that I could improve it. </h4>

<h2>How should I use the script?</h2>

Follow these steps to use the script:

1. <a href="#Download-this-way">Download</a> these two files namely, login.py and dependencies.sh. 
2. Open file login.py in your favorite text editor and put your entry no. and password in line no. 22 and 26 respectively. Now save the file.
3. Open file dependencies.sh in text editor and put your computer user_name instead of lavee_singh in line 13 and 15. Now save the file.
4. Open terminal and run dependencies file using 
	```
	sudo sh dependencies.sh
	```
5. Convert the login.py into executable by using:
	```
	chmod a+x login.py
	```
6. Run the file by:
		a. double clicking and and choosing run option.
		b. running ```./login.py``` command in terminal


<h2>Now, you might want to run this script automatically on startup or whenever you get automatically logged out, I'll be adding instructions for that in a day or two.</h2>
